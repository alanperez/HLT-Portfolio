# HLT-Portfolio

Introduction to human language technologies (HLT), the study of natural languages from a computational perspective. Topics include computational models of syntax and semantics, natural language applications (such as machine translation, speech processing, information retrieval, and information extraction), and general machine-learning techniques commonly used in state-of-the-art HLT research.

# Pogram 1 Overview - Text Processing

The [requirements based off the document](https://github.com/alanperez/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Text-Processing/Portfolio%20Component%201.pdf) and the [main program is here](https://github.com/alanperez/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Text-Processing/homework1-axp200075.py)

Program will read data from a csv file, will format correctly based off the helper function and display the employees data

There are two ways to run this program 
* Terminal
  * running the command `python homework1-axp200075.py data/data.csv`
  
* PyCharm(IDE)
  * Select "Edit Configurations" under the Run menu tab
  * Under the script field select the homework file
  * In the parameters add the file name then save
  * Click the run button on the ide

This program is a guessing game where it reads the input file as raw text, calculate the lexical diversity of the tokenized text and output it,

There are two ways to run this program 
* Terminal
  * running the command `python homework1-axp200075.py data/data.csv`
  
* PyCharm(IDE)
  * Select "Edit Configurations" under the Run menu tab
  * Under the script field select the homework file
  * In the parameters add the file name then save
  * Click the run button on the ide
  
  
# Program 3 Overview - WordNet

The [requirements based off the document](https://github.com/alanperez/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/WordNet/Portfolio%20Chapter%207%20WordNet.pdf) and the [main program is here](https://github.com/alanperez/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/WordNet/CS4395_001_WordNet_AXP200075.ipynb)

# Program 4 Overview - N-Grams

The [requirements based off the document](https://github.com/alanperez/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/N-Grams/Portfolio%20Chapter%208%20N-grams.pdf) and the [first part of the program is here](https://github.com/alanperez/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/N-Grams/ngram-part1-axp200075.py) and the [second part of the program is here](https://github.com/alanperez/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/N-Grams/ngram-part2-axp200075.py)

[NGRAMS NARRATIVE HERE](https://github.com/alanperez/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/N-Grams/CS4395.001-AXP200075-NGRAM-Summarydocx.pdf)

In this homework you will create bigram and unigram dictionaries for English, French, and Italian
using the provided training data where the key is the unigram or bigram text and the value is the
count of that unigram or bigram in the data. Then for the test data, calculate probabilities for
each language and compare against the true labels.



To run this program,

* PyCharm(IDE)
  * First make sure the theres a data folder with all the contents in the same working directory
  * run the first part of the program, once ran there should be a list of pickles in the same working directory
  * run the second program and it should display all the results



# Assignment 5 Overview - Sentence Parsing

Write a fairly complex sentence. The sentence should have at least 12 tokens. More points are
awarded for sentences with more than one clause.

The [requirements based off the document](https://github.com/alanperez/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/AO5-Parsing/Portfolio%20Component%20Sentence%20Parsing.pdf) and the [sentence assignment is here](https://github.com/alanperez/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/AO5-Parsing/Parsing.pdf)

The [requirements based off the document](https://github.com/alanperez/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Web%20Crawler/Portfolio%20Chapter%2012%20-%20Web%20Crawler.pdf) and the [main part of the program is here](https://github.com/alanperez/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/Web%20Crawler/webcrawl.py)

[Report](https://github.com/alanperez/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/N-Grams/CS4395.001-AXP200075-NGRAM-Summarydocx.pdf)

A program that crawls over the web from link to link extracting information



To run this program,

* PyCharm(IDE)
  * run the program, should output cleaned up text files within the same directory of each file.
  * the results should be printed in the terminal
  
  
# Notebook Overview - Text Classification

I used a Twitter Sentiment Analysis dataset where I looked at the sentiment of tweets and classified it based on it being positive,negative, and neutral

The [requirements based off the document](https://github.com/alanperez/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/text-classification/Portfolio%20Text%20Classification%201.pdf) and the [notebook is here](https://github.com/alanperez/HLT-Portfolio/blob/main/text-classification/CS4395_001_TEXT_CLASSIFICATION_AXP200075.ipynb)

# Program Overview - Chatbot

Project Objective: Create a chatbot using NLP techniques learned in class. The chatbot should
be able to carry on a limited conversation in a particular domain using a knowledge base or
knowledge from the web, and knowledge it learns from the user.

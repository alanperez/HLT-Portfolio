# HLT-Portfolio

Introduction to human language technologies (HLT), the study of natural languages from a computational perspective. Topics include computational models of syntax and semantics, natural language applications (such as machine translation, speech processing, information retrieval, and information extraction), and general machine-learning techniques commonly used in state-of-the-art HLT research.

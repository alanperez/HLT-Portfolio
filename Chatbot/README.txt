I've included my API for TMDB

In order to run is by using PyCharm and manually running the program. Once ran it should automatically generate the Knowledge_Base
but it's probably best just to use the knowledge_base.txt file provided and users_models.p if you run into any issues. 

An issue you might run into is when it prompts for the name it might not accept it the first time. My name is Jack, I'm Jack, Jack these 3 ways should work.

When you first run it, prompts user, if new user it creates it inside the txt file. It asks for genre of movie(drama, horror thriller, action, fantasy, science fiction) or you can simply type the name of the movie and it should give back a list or the movie details.
